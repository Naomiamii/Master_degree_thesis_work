Title: Beyond polarization in divisive topics: a case study on cooking and traveling discourse on Instagram and Youtube.

Summary: This research examines polarization in non-traditional domains (food and travel) using sentiment as a measure of distance between users on Instagram and YouTube. Results demonstrate that negative sentiment contagion occurs with initial negative comments increasing the likelihood of next negative responses. Network analysis reveals polarization patterns in food discussions, where negative nodes cluster in small, ightly-connected communities while positive nodes dominate larger communities.
